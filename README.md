This is my take on a split ergonomic keyboard.
I will add documentation to buid it here soon.

# Versions
## 1.0
This version is not my own creation. 
I found it here on [GitHub](https://github.com/Schievel1/dactyl_manuform_r_track).
This is where I started from.

## 2.0
This was my first creation.
I reduced the number of keys from 62 to 46 and tented to make it more ergonomic.
I added holes for the USB cables and reset buttons.
There was a major error on this one where I mirrored the left side to make the right. This made non of the hot swap sockets work.
This one is the most difficult to make.

## 3.0
This is my second creation.
I do not recomend this one.
It is too big.
I didn't realize until I printed it.

## 4.0
This is my third creation.
I do not recomend this one.
I never finished designing it.
Part way through I abandoned it to pursue what became 5.0.

## 5.0
This is my fourth creation.
This one is fine. 
This was the one that reduced the number of keys to 34.
I didn't know what to do with the thumb clusters so they got placed to far away.

## 6.0
This is my fifth creation.
I really like this one. 
This one reduced the number of keys to 29.
I currently use this one daily at work and was posted to reddit.
The 29 keys make it so there is no doubt of what key you are using because each finger has a maximum of 3 keys.
